Challenge for Backend Internship at Gocase

[Problem which this project plans to solve](https://github.com/kimlima/gocase-backend-challenge-internship) 

This API follows [this book](http://apionrails.icalialabs.com/book/frontmatter), but skipping some parts,
mostly because some were 'optional' and/or were having problems which seemed too much time consuming.
Every important change will be commented here or in the respective file.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version
  
  ruby 2.4.4.p296

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

  For simplicity, won't have in the beginning. If time and skill allow, may be added.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)
